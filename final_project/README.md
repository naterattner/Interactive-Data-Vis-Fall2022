# Interactive Data Visualization: Final Project

## Prospectus

Americans formed new businesses in historic numbers during the pandemic. Monthly business applications spiked to the highest level on record in early 2020 and haven’t slowed since. 

I am to explore the U.S. Census Bureau’s [Business Formation Statistics data](https://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html) in an effort to understand and explain who and what is driving this trend. This might include:

- Overall trends: What was the timing of when this trend took off, and how elevated are the current numbers relative to the pandemic peak?

- Business applications by industry: What types of companies are Americans starting? 

- Geographic trends: Where are these companies forming? Are there trends by region? More granularly, there is annual county-level data starting in 2005 which was recently released for 2021.

- Demographic trends: By combining the county-level business formations data with other Census data such on race and ethnicity, household income, and education levels, we might gain more insight into who is starting these new companies.

My initial idea is to do this as a sort of two-part dashboard. The first would be aimed at showing change-over-time data, to offer insight into the first two bullet points above (overall and industry trends). The second would be a map, which would both visualize trends and allow users to explore more granular data. Depending on what comes out of an initial exploration of the data, however, this project could turn into more of a story if a clear narrative emerges.
