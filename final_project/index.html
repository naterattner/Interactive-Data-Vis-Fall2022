          Amid a generational shock to the economic system, Americans formed new businesses in historic numbers following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. This pace has hardly slowed since.

          After a sharp decline in the spring of 2020, new business applications surged, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics show. Applications hit a record in July of that year, and remain elevated compared to prepandemic levels as of October 2022.

        <p>
          The surge in business applications has been uneven in many ways. There was a larger increase in applications for businesses that the Census Bureau deems unlikely to hire additional employees, for example, than for those who are likely to hire. There were also large spikes in the Midwest and South, along with the utilities, transportation, and retail sectors.
